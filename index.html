<h1>How To Copy A Keycard</h1>
	<p>This started because every time I had to visit my friend's student accomodation, he would have to come outside to open the gate. And that was a bit inefficient each time. And then I thought "I am a CS student, surely keycards can't be that complicated". They are complicated. Especially when you start looking into how the keep them secure. But luckily for me there was a kit[2] and a website[2] online</p>
