<h1>How To Copy A Keycard</h1>
	<p>This started because every time I had to visit my friend's student accomodation, he would have to come outside to open the gate. And that was a bit inefficient. And then I thought "I am a CS student, surely keycards can't be that complicated". They are complicated. Especially when you start looking into how to keep them secure. But luckily for me there was a kit[2] and a website[1] that was intended for beginners.</p>
	<br>
	<p>I would encourage you to check out the website as it has much a more detailed explanation of how the entire system works. This webpage is just intended as a record of my troubleshooting process.</p>
